Required Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

brief report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.

Summary of Findings

I conducted a basic analysis of the coupon acceptance data and found the following insights:

The overall coupon acceptance rate is 56.84%.

The top occupations with the highest coupon acceptance rates are:

Construction and Extraction: 68.83%
Healthcare Practitioners and Technical: 67.6%

The most frequently accepted coupons were for **coffee** and **least expensive restaurants**. Additionally, these coupons were most commonly redeemed around **2 PM in the afternoon**.

Next, I analyzed the drivers most likely to accept bar coupons. Overall, the acceptance rate for bar coupons was **41%**. Drivers who visit bars more than three times a month were significantly more likely to accept the coupons compared to those who visit less frequently:  

- **Acceptance Rate for Less than 3 Visits per Month**: 37.07%  
- **Acceptance Rate for More than 3 Visits per Month**: 76.88%

I then compared the acceptance rate of bar coupons between two groups: drivers who visit bars more than once a month and are over 25 years old versus all other drivers. The findings are as follows:

Acceptance Rate for Drivers with More than 1 Visit and Over 25 Years Old: 69.52%
Acceptance Rate for All Other Drivers: 33.50%

I further analyzed the acceptance rate of bar coupons among drivers who visit bars more than once a month, had passengers other than children, and worked in occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry. The results are:

Acceptance Rate for Drivers Meeting These Criteria: 71.32%
Acceptance Rate for All Other Drivers: 29.60%

Next, I visualized the occupational data of the drivers to determine if specific occupations were more likely to influence the use of bar coupons. This analysis aimed to identify trends in coupon acceptance based on occupational groups.
